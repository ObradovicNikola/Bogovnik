# Bogovnik

Bogovnik is an exploration of the connection between augmented reality and paganism in its digital form, or symbols and objects through the prism of ancient Slavic Pagan mythology. It's an augmented reality application that lets you see the recreations of the Slavic pagan deities when you use your phone to look at digitally printed carpets, that are a part of the exhibition.
